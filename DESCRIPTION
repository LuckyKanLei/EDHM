Description: Realization method of basic hydrological module.
    Realize flexible switching between modules and build a complete runoff model.
    All calculation methods support vectorization (matrix) calculation, 
    which is convenient to build distributed hydrological model.
    Six basic modules have been realized: 
    evapotranspiration, closure, runoff generation, groundwater and confluence.
    1. Evapotranspiration module includes two processes: 
    potential (Reference) evapotranspiration and actual evapotranspiration. 
    There are two methods for reference evapotranspiration: Hargreaves, Penman. 
    There is one method to actually evaporate: VIC.
    2. There is a method for in module: Gash.
    3. There are four methods for the runoff module: OIER, SER, VIC, VM.
    4. There is a method for groundwater module: VIC.
    5. The base flow module has one method: ARNO.
    6. there are three methods of Instantaneous unit hydrograph: Nash, RuiXF, Shipeng.
    7. There is an existing method of route module: G2RES, 
    but it can still be designed arbitrarily.
    Due to the limitation of the author 's personal ability, there may be some shortcomings or mistakes. 
    I hope to contact myself, and I will make corrections in time. 
    It is also expected to be able to communicate with more friends 
    the simulation methods of the distributed hydrological model.
